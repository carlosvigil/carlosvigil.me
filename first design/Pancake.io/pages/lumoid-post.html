            Rented the Pebble Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, Striiv Fusion, Garmin Viv&oacute;smart,
            and Moov from <a href="http://www.lumoid.com/" target="_blank">Lumoid</a>.
        </h4>

        <p>
            Interestingly enough, I knew I didn't need any of them, that they'd be more annoyance than practical gadget. But,
             I still went along with it and K was kind enough to do so with me. Long story short the Moov is the only winner
             and only because I have an interest in improving my running and K likes tracking her calories burned now.
            <a href="https://moov.cc/getmoov/1B6329B57B" target="_blank">Moov</a> is now offering their next generation
             device at discount increments of 40, 50, and 60 percent depending on how many you order.

        <h5>lumoid notes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>pebble watch charger sucks; weak magnets, falls off a lot</li>
            <li>Striiv charger better</li>
            <li>both light</li>
            <li>both feel good (haven&#8217;t worn yet)</li>
            <li>pebble apps are exciting</li>
            <li>kind of annoying to have both wrists vibrating about lifeline</li>
            <li>pebble is useful, more info, bigger screen, easier to read</li>
            <li>striiv fusion is difficult to read. bad angles.</li>
            <li>games in pebble are fun</li>
        </ul>
