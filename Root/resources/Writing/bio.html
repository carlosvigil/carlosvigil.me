    <p>
        I'm not interested in making a "bio" since writers since the beginning of writing haven't been able to encapsulate life with words. They tell stories and I don't have much of one to share. I'll try. 
        <b>
        There <i>is</i> love. It starts within, go outside afterwards. And, remember: you're still alone.</b>

    <p>
        I'm a student, of life, and hoping to complete an associate's degree in computer science for mobile application development by Summer 2017.

        I love anything mobile. I like fast things, I like slow things. I love design. I doubt there's "bad" design so I won't say, "I like good design," because any thought put in to action is a good thing.
