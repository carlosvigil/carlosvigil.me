    <a href="../index.html"><h3>To fledge out my site I've added an introduction.</h3></a>

    <p>First, and foremost, I am writing this on an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2">
        iPad Air 2</a> with an external bluetooth keyboard. I mention this because
        I'd like to promote and develop the mobile revolution and a minimal lifestyle.</p>

    <p>It's been irritating at best to follow this motion, when dealing with others,
        but to me the benefits are worth doing so. Besides, what's the use in doing
        something if you're going to let others bring you down?</p>

    <blockquote>"Where there's a will there's a way."</blockquote>

    <p>Most of the issue resides in misconceptions. ("they" from here on refers
        to the general populace) They, believe these devices are a sort of luxury
        or consumer device, as in it's only purpose is to consume, i.e. entertainment.
        But I saw them as well designed, portable computers. And so I do all my work on it.</p>

    <p>Part of the switch, or maybe my own preference, says that my iPad is too big.
       I can't hold it in one hand comfortably, so I will pass this one on in favor of a Mini 4.</p>

    <p class="text-xs-center "><b>. . .</b></p>

    <p>I didn't get the Mini 4.
    <br /> But, K got a Mini 2.</p>
