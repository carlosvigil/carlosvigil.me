    <a href="../index.html"><h3>Tested out 5 wearables with the gf.</h3></a><h4>
        Rented the Pebble Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, Striiv Fusion, Garmin Viv&oacute;smart,
        and Moov from <a href="http://www.lumoid.com/" target="_blank">Lumoid</a>.</h4>

    <p>Interestingly enough, I knew I didn't need any of them, that they'd be more annoyance than practical gadget.
        But, I still went along with it and K was kind enough to do so with me.
        Long story short the Moov is the only winner and only because I have an
        interest in improving my running and K likes tracking her calories burned now.
        <a href="https://moov.cc/getmoov/1B6329B57B" target="_blank">Moov</a>
        is now offering their next generation device at discount increments of 40, 50, and 60 percent depending on how many you order.</p>

    <h5>lumoid notes</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>pebble watch charger sucks; weak magnets, falls off a lot</li>
      <li>Striiv charger better</li>
      <li>both light</li>
      <li>both feel good (haven&#8217;t worn yet)</li>
      <li>pebble apps are exciting</li>
      <li>kind of annoying to have both wrists vibrating about lifeline</li>
      <li>pebble is useful, more info, bigger screen, easier to read</li>
      <li>striiv fusion is difficult to read. bad angles.</li>
      <li>games in pebble are fun</li>
    </ul>
