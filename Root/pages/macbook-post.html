<h4>First Mac[book]</h4>

<p>
    Well, well. I got a Macbook Pro. Apparently, it’s the early 2015 one, or maybe they mean that’s the design date. It was updated
    a few months ago with a better processor and a force touch trackpad (from what the rep told me). It’s taking
    a little getting used to, to type and spread my fingers more since the keyboard is wider. Also, there’s no double
    space shortcut for punctuation.
