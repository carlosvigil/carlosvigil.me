# The Direction I Needed

## In a confluence of passion and desire I found my own.

For a while now I've been avoiding computers. Through high school and elementary I've dabbled in everything but coding. I was bored and curious and I loved how others created content, so I wanted to learn to do the same. I played with video/audio making, recording, and editing, photoshop, flash, and, of course MySpace HTML. I never put more time than learning the skill took, and I never shared my work. As responsibility loomed, I thought it foolish to be sedentary. To sit behind a monitor, on a comfy chair, for the majority of life was ridiculous to me. Until, working physically taxing jobs rang my future-health-issue-alarm. I thought, "This hurts, and I'm barely functioning. So much for making work my workout." It's a balance we need, and making work hard on me wasn't a long-term solution. I was the fool.

I listen to a lot of podcasts now: all, but TED Radio, are about programming. I've got a long list of episode to catch up on, half because I don't want to miss out, and the other half because there is so much good content out there. The reason I'm writing this can be linked to Developer Tea and The Shop Talk Show. One episode of the latter sparked a fire in me. It was about animation. A guest explained how she would like to see animations used and struck a chord. I had to check her CodePen out; she mentioned one in particular:

"CodePen -- Context-Shifting in UX Patterns by sdras"

> This to me is beautiful and functional. It makes sense to me that I wasn't into tech/web before. It was ugly. It's getting prettier. I want to do this... -- a message to my partner That's when it clicked. I wasn't entirely sure I knew what she meant by context-switching, but, as soon as I saw it, I knew. That's what I'm aiming for; that's what I need to be doing. It was so quick, it was so fluid, it worked. The slight changes helped draw my eye to the content. Another connection was made in that moment, that I had seen this before.

### It just feels good.

The menu system in specific is what drew me back to this particular application. I can't attest to finally finding a human who mastered trees, but he definitely made it feel and sound good. Animations are not peripheral things, they have the potential to accomplish more. What if opening folders on a PC had the same satisfying, unobtrusive bleep and animation? The major gap missing from touch screens and web in general is the lack of human flair opposing all the blocks and squares. It can be seen in newer apps where developers take the liberty to make witty or quirky comments. And, it can be seen in this app, iOS to some extent, and Sarah's CodePen.

I hope to find solutions or follow in the footsteps of these designers/engineers. I plan to keep exercising when I'm not being obsessive about code. Thanks to Free Code Camp, and the wonderful, spectacular, amazing coding community, I'm finding my place.
